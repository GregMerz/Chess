# Chess

Welcome to my Chess program! This is a little side project that I made to test and challenge my coding skills.

## How to play

When the game first begins, it is white's turn to move.  You can hover your mouse over any of the white pieces and it will highlight the square green and any squares the piece can move to in grey.

To start your turn, click on a piece that you wish to move.  Now that it is selected, the piece's square will be highlighted in red and all of its possible moves in grey.  If you decide you do not want to move that piece, just right-click anywhere to deselect it.

Lastly, click any of the possible moves to finish your turn.  Next is black's turn so have a friend make the next move!

## Goals

Currently, I want to implement machine learning to create an AI by using neural networks.  The next thing I want to do is enable remote play.
